The new Graphical User Interface (GUI) is contributed by SWITCH 
<a href="http://www.switch.ch">http://www.switch.ch</a> by funding the work of Ivan Guajana

<a name="rno"><h3>Older Release Notes</h3></a>
<b>v0.2:</b><br>
XMeeting 0.2 uses a slightly different preferences system than XMeeting 0.1.
New is the use of Accounts for H.323 and SIP. This means that the H.323 gatekeeper settings
will be lost when launching XMeeting 0.2. You will have to add this information again in the
preferences window, section &quot;Accounts&quot;. Alternatively, you can remove the preferences
file (usually found at ~/Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.xmeeting.xmeeting.plist) and use
the Setup Assistant to setup XMeeting.
<br>
<br>
New features:
<ul>
<li>Support for the SIP protocol. XMeeting can now do both H.323 and SIP. The
SIP support is still basic and is not yet considered stable. Also, in the current
version, only the H.261 and H.263 video codecs are supported when using SIP</li>
<li>Support for H.224/H.281 (Far End Camera Control) to improve compatiblility with
Codian MCUs.
<li>Improved H.323 system to improve compatibility with other clients</li>
<li>Improved H.263 compatibility</li>
<li>Improved handling of resources if video is disabled</li>
<li>Various GUI improvements</li>
<li>Much, much more...</li>
</ul>

Fixed bugs:
<ul>
<li>Fixes incorrect bandwidth requests when making calls using a gatekeeper</li>
<li>Fixes problems when a phone number was entered with spaces in between</li>
<li>Fixes a bug that prevented the Address Book from appearing for the second time</li>
<li>Fixes a problem that if no remote video was received, it wasn't possible to access
the in-call controls</li>
<li>Adds a workaround for the case that the H.263 decoder starts displaying a green screen
instead of the remote video</li>
<li>Adds a workaround for improved handling of video on older machines</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>v0.1:</b>
<br>
This is the first &quot;official&quot; beta release of XMeeting which ships with the following
features:

<ul>
<li>Support for the H.323 protocol. SIP support is planned.</li>
<li>A new implementation of the underlying XMeeting framework, redesigned from scratch.
This framework builds upon the PWLib and OPAL libraries from the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openh323">OpenH323 project</a></li>
<li>Support for QuickTime video codecs, improving the quality and bandwidth usage compared
to ohphoneX.</li>
<li>Supported video codecs: H.264 (partially), H.263 and H.261. Sending H.264 will not work
in most cases unless sending between two XMeeting clients. There exists an option
&quot;Enable H.264 Limited Mode&quot; in preferences that allows to send H.264 with a
limited bandwidth used and certain other restrictions. However, <b>this mode is NOT 
standard compliant</b>!</li>
<li>Supported audio codecs: G.711 uLaw and ALaw. More codecs will be added later</li>
<li>A completely redesigned Graphical User Interface (GUI) with support for FullScreen video,
Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and many other useful features.</li>
<li>The concept of encapsulating relevant preferences in a super-set, called location. This makes 
it easy to adjust the application behaviour to your current location. (e.g. &quot;Home&quot; or
&quot;Office&quot;)</li>
<li>A new system for providing video input, using a modular interface. XMeeting ships with two
modules, a Live Camera Module for QuickTime compatible webcams and a Screen Module for capturing
and sending screen content.</li>
<li>A new Setup Assistant for first-time launch. The assistant can also be used for importing
locations from existing files, intelligently asking the user for the missing information. This
is the ideal solution for distributing XMeeting along with predefined preferences. Please contact
Hannes Friederich if you plan to use this feature.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a name="bug"><h3>Known Bugs</h3></a>
<ul>
<li>In some rare cases, calling a remote party seems to take long time without showing any 
success.</li>
<li>After some calls, XMeeting is no longer registered at a gatekeeper, even if indicating so.
Terminating XMeeting may take a long time in this case.</li>
<li>XMeeting may crash randomly and rarely when in a call. This is especially true when receiving
H.264</li>
</ul>
